# Maze Solver Visualization

This project visualizes the generation and solving of a maze using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms. The visualization includes real-time updates of the solving process.

## 📋 Description

The Maze Solver Visualization demonstrates:
- Maze generation with randomized depth-first search.
- Real-time maze solving using BFS and DFS algorithms.

The project is built with vanilla JavaScript and uses the `<canvas>` element for rendering. It's designed to be easy to use and understand for those learning algorithms and visualization techniques.

### 🏆 Main Features

1. **Maze Generation**:
    - Dynamically generates a maze using a randomized DFS algorithm.
    - Visual representation of walls and paths.

2. **Solving Algorithms**:
    - Solves the maze using BFS and DFS.
    - Shows the step-by-step process with visual updates.

3. **Interactive Controls**:
    - Buttons to solve the maze with BFS or DFS, reset the maze, and clear solving progress.
